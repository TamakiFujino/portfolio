            Digital Autonomy is an exhibition of digital photography, video, painting, sculpture,
            and unclassifiable media hosted on New Art City that explores the multitude of interdependent signals
            crisscrossing the spatio-temporal void. While never physically co-present,
            Seniors in their culminating semester of their BFA degree in Digital Media Art
            came together in digital space and found synaptic resonance;
            a cognitive sympathy fostered by digital signals.
            <br><br>
            The name itself, Digital Autonomy, is a linguistic performance of cognitive dissidence.
            All digital objects are destined for translation, an act that requires a source, processor,
            and intended receiver. It begs the question; can any digital-thing, be autonomous?
            <br><br>
            Digital Autonomy asks the viewer to engage in fantasy, consider the physicality of the bodies they inhabit,
            cast spells over networks, and pokes holes in the cultures of post-colonial frameworks.
            As we begin to slowly emerge from our socially distant adaptations,
            the work imagines new possibilities for the kind of world we are passing into.
            The artists in Digital Autonomy suggest new forms of relationships between signals, objects,
            and environments; redefining body & space on their own terms. <br>(From Digital Autonomy webpage) <br><br><br>

            <b>[ COLLABORATION ]</b><br><br>

            I contributed the project as a lead of the web design team,
            collaborating with other teams. <br><br><br>

            My piece in this project is about digital identity.
            I created MAX MSP patch that generates face filters.
            This filters are generated based on the input of your phone number.
            This piece was initially created for my BFA solo exhibition.

            <br><br>
            For this online exhibition on New Art City,
            I have re-created filters using 10 examples from the MAX MSP patch.
            You can try those filters on Instagram.   <br><br>

            CV dazzle by Adam Harvey made me realize
            digital media artists can reveal how the digital world works and how we are influenced by that.
            Inspired by that, this piece helps you discover who we are and how we are recognized by the digital world.
            The data and information in the modern world are created for machines to read effectively,
            ignoring how humans read them.  In the machine-centered world,
            one of the biggest identities of us is our phone number randomly assigned by phone companies,
            rather than your name or number.
            We almost stopped using phone numbers to call someone anymore.
            The people who do not have phone numbers will be excluded from society
            as you cannot make a credit card and create an account to sign up for a service.
            <br>
            The lobby object represents a bellow created with the repetition of Yamaori and Taniori. Yamaori and Taniori indicates how to fold when you do origami. I did not put any texture on the object since the object itself represents the nature
            of
            everything. Without any covering, you cannot tell which area are concave and convex of the bellow.
