      This piece is created to explain how being minority is difficult in the society. Tamaki created a series of stickers of souvenir that you can buy at the hospical when you or your family gives a birth.

<br>Tamaki, even in Japanese, is a rare name. Everyone know every sightseeing place has a keyholder, mugcup, cup, car plate, and sticker with indivisual name. If your name is not common name, you would look for something with your initial like "T" instead of Tamaki. In the commercial perspective, it is a waste to make goods that cannot be owned by the majority. <br>

When it comes to race, it is the same thing. Race usually categorized with a broad border such as white, yellow, brown, and black. You probably have an experience that you need to check your race whenever you need to enter your personal information. The choices of checkbox usually are: (1) American Indian (2) Alaska Native (3) Asian (4) Black / African American (5) White (6) Hispanic
However, what if you are mix raced, like you have Japanese mother and white father, or more complicated. Also, Tamaki always thinks that I am Asian, but Asia is such a big religion. If there are souvenirs that those area name on them, like the logo of "Asia" printed on a sticker, would you buy one? If it was "Japan" instead of "Asia", I would be more interested in it. <br>

The concept of this work is challenging becuase Tamaki is a straight person and identifies herself as female. She has learned that there are babies who are born as intersex. Intersex is a term that indicates the indivisual is inbetween male and female. It could be having both physical features of female and male, or the sex of gene and sex of physical features do not match. <br>
She never heard of this term for twenty years. She considered that LGBTQ community had been considered as minority, because we have not educated from our early age. Then most of parents who get a intersex child know about intersex. Often times, a doctor tells parents to decide which sex they are hoping and based on that, the child get a surgery or hormone treatment to be male or female. But sometimes that decision could go wrong after the child grow up. Since intersex is not about only physical features, sometimes it cannot be visible. Then the child could doubt about their sexual identity later. Intersex is not very rare case (about 1.7%), but the society has been classfied our sex as only two, male or female, because it is easier for the society to deal with like souvenirs with names that mentioned above. If we get educated about intersex, we should have much deeper understanding of categorization of sex. <br>
The stickers in this piece mainly have two pattern. <br> One bigger completed sticker with all elements on the left section: <br>
- Sex: "It's a boy!" (Blue-color base) or "it's a girl" (Pink-color base) <br>
- Race: "Whilte, yellow, brown, black"  <br>

<br>On the right section, there is "New! Create Your Own" section. There are a plain base that you can write down a baby's name, height, wright, date, and time,<br>
various skin tone, and four main types of intersex that are 46 XX intersex, 46 XY intersex, true gonadal intersex, and complex intersex. You can create a sticker for your new-born baby with combining them together if your baby cannot be classfied with male or female, or while, yellow, brown, or black. Recently the group of minorities started being accepted. However, the existance of intersex is recognized since 1917, but still it is not a part of education of sex. Also, if you need to buy a "create your own" sticker, you need to spend extra dollars. (a completed sticker costs $2.99 and each part of create your own costs also $2.99). The society superfacially says that we are equal and they accept all the minorities, but economically, the minories need more efforts to be equal.
